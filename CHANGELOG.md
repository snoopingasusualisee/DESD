Saved data can be overwritten via: `python manage.py dumpdata marketplace.Category --indent 2 > marketplace/fixtures/categories.json`, which will take from your local sqlite3 file) (EXTRA NOTE: different db models will have to be dumped separately, e.g. accounts being `python manage.py dumpdata accounts --indent 2 > marketplace/fixtures/accounts.json`.)

- Added `clean_role` method to `CustomerRegistrationForm`, rejecting any non-whitelisted role at form validation level
- Fixed CSRF logout vulnerability: `logout_view` now requires POST (`@require_POST`): all logout links across all templates replaced with CSRF-token-protected POST forms (covers all 15 templates: accounts, marketplace, orders)
- Improved `add_product` access control: non-producers now receive `403 Forbidden` instead of a silent redirect
- Security review of merged code from main: confirmed all new orders views (`cart`, `checkout`, `order_detail`, `order_list`, `manage_orders`, `manage_order_detail`) are correctly guarded with `@login_required` and role checks (`_is_customer`, `_is_producer`), confirmed `edit_product` and `delete_product` use ownership-scoped `get_object_or_404` preventing cross-producer access
